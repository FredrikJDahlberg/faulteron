# Cuts the link between the leader and one follower, and only that link, while the cluster streams; then heals it.
#
# THE FAULT: on the leader's interface, all UDP to and from the follower's host is dropped (--peer, every port).
# The other follower still reaches both. The cut-off follower hears no leader, so it times out and stands for
# election, and the only member it can ask is one that still has a leader. A Raft without pre-vote and leader
# stickiness lets it depose a healthy leader, over and over; one with them keeps the leader.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS:
#   1. The fault fired: the leader's interface dropped packets to and from the follower.
#   2. The leader keeps leading: no election completes while the follower is cut off.
#   3. A ClusterProbe confirm producer on the other follower, streaming throughout, sees every frame on its tap
#      exactly once, in order.
#   4. Healed, the cut-off follower catches up: a ping through its tap passes.
