#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Makes the leader's links slow, jittery and duplicating while the cluster streams, then heals them.
#
# THE FAULT: on the leader's interface, everything to or from a member's internal ports or the leader's ingress port
# leaves DELAY_MS plus up to JITTER_MS late, which reorders it, and DUPLICATE_PCT% of it, in either direction, is
# delivered twice. The worst case, DELAY_MS + JITTER_MS, stays under the cluster's 200 ms leader heartbeat timeout,
# and the 20 ms heartbeat interval is shorter than the jitter: heartbeats arrive late, out of order and twice, but
# never too far apart.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS:
#   1. The fault fired: the leader's interface delayed and duplicated packets.
#   2. No election: a slow link under the timeout is not a dead one.
#   3. Every member's tap stayed current: a ping through each passes under the fault.
#   4. A ClusterProbe confirm producer on a follower, streaming throughout, sees every frame on its tap exactly once,
#      in order — Aeron discards the duplicates and reorders what jitter shuffled.
