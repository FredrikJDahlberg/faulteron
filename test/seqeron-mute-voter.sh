# Mutes one follower's ballots, kills the leader, and heals the follower after HOLD_SECS without a leader.
#
# THE FAULT: on the follower's interface, every RequestVote and Vote it sends to a peer's consensus port is dropped.
# The rest of its consensus traffic flows, so it replicates, acknowledges and canvasses like any follower, and
# nothing shows until an election: then the two survivors are up and connected, but the muted one cannot ask for a
# vote or give one, and neither reaches a quorum of two. Only a filter on the message inside the frame can produce
# this; a blocked port takes the follower out of the cluster before the leader dies.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS:
#   1. The fault is latent: under it, before the kill, no election runs and every member's tap answers a ping.
#   2. With the leader dead, no leader emerges in HOLD_SECS, several times a normal election.
#   3. The fault fired: ballots were dropped.
#   4. Healed, the survivors elect a leader, and the killed member, restarted, rejoins as its follower.
#   5. A ClusterProbe confirm producer on the muted follower, streaming throughout, sees every frame on its tap
#      exactly once, in order.
