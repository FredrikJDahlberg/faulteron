#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Partitions the leader of seqeron's three-node docker cluster from its peers while a producer streams through it,
# then heals the partition.
#
# THE FAULT: every member's archive, consensus, log and transfer port is blocked on the leader's interface, in both
# directions. Its ingress port and the clients' egress stay open, so the leader can still accept ingress it can no
# longer replicate. A process kill never produces that: the old leader takes frames that the new term discards.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS:
#   1. The fault fired: the leader's interface dropped packets on the blocked ports.
#   2. The majority elects a new leader while the old one is cut off.
#   3. Healed, the old leader rejoins as a follower of the new term.
#   4. A ClusterProbe confirm producer on a majority member, streaming throughout, sees every frame on its tap exactly
#      once, in order — PendingSends resent what the old leader took and lost. A second, untracked producer is the
#      control: its loss is reported, not asserted, and is the evidence the partition had frames in flight.
