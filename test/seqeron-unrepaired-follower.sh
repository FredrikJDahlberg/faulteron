# Starves one follower of log repair while the cluster streams, then heals it.
#
# THE FAULT: LOSS_PCT% of the log DATA sent to the follower's log port is dropped, and so is one half of Aeron's
# repair, chosen by REPAIR:
#   nak         (default) every NAK the follower sends from that port, dropped on the follower's interface;
#   retransmit  every retransmission the leader sends to that port, dropped on the leader's interface.
# Aeron repairs loss only by a NAK answered with a retransmit, so the first lost datagram leaves a hole the
# follower's log image cannot get past: it stops applying the log while still hearing the leader on the consensus
# channel, so no election is called. A process kill or pause never produces a member that is up, connected and
# silently behind.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS:
#   1. The fault fired: log DATA and the chosen repair half were dropped.
#   2. The follower fell behind: a ping through its tap, which passed before the fault, times out under it.
#   3. The rest of the cluster kept sequencing: a ClusterProbe confirm producer on the other follower, streaming
#      throughout, sees every frame on its tap exactly once, in order.
#   4. Healed, the follower catches up: a ping through its tap passes again.
